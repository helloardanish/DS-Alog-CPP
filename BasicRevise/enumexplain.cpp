// Enumeration


/*

enum spectrum {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, indigo, ultraviolet};

It makes spectrum the name of a new type; spectrum is termed an enumeration, much as a struct variable is called a structure.
It establishes red, orange, yellow,and so on,as symbolic constants for the integer values 0â€“7.These constants are called enumerators.


The only valid values that you can assign to an enumeration variable without a typecast are the enumerator values used in defining the type.Thus, we have the following:
band = blue; // valid, blue is an enumerator
band = 2000; // invalid, 2000 not an enumerator


You can assign an int value to an enum, provided that the value is valid and that you use an explicit type cast:
band = spectrum(3); // typecast 3 to type spectrum



You can set enumerator values explicitly by using the assignment operator:
enum bits{one = 1, two = 2, four = 4, eight = 8};
